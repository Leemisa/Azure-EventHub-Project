ðŸ“ˆ Real-Time Stock Data Streamer to Azure Event Hub
Overview
This project implements a Python-based real-time data streaming client that generates simulated stock market data and sends it continuously to an Azure Event Hub.
It is designed to simulate realistic stock trading environments for academic, testing, and stream analytics purposes, serving as an input for real-time processing pipelines on Azure.

Features
Dynamic Data Generation: Randomly generates stock event data with the following attributes:

Stock Symbol: Selected from a predefined list (AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA).

Price: A floating-point number between $100 and $500.

Volume: A random integer between 100 and 5000 shares.

Timestamp: Current UTC time in ISO 8601 format.

Event Streaming: Continuously sends generated data to Azure Event Hub at two-second intervals.

Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable for additional symbols, data points, or faster/slower intervals.

User-Friendly Shutdown: Allows graceful exit via keyboard interruption (CTRL+C).

Requirements
Python 3.7 or newer

Azure Event Hub service setup

Python Package: Install the required library using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install azure-eventhub
Configuration
The script uses the following configuration:

python
Copy
Edit
CONNECTION_STR = 'Endpoint=sb://itri613-eventhub-project.servicebus.windows.net/;SharedAccessKeyName=ITRI613-EVENTHUB-PROJECT-StreamAnalytics_it_policy;SharedAccessKey=fmqa6FH0SRpDeYc7KLAuddGQKEWyUmFYj+AEhIKuHys=;EntityPath=itri613-eventhub-hub'
EVENTHUB_NAME = 'itri613-eventhub-hub'
These settings ensure that events are properly directed to the configured Event Hub namespace and event hub instance.

How It Works
Establish a secure connection to the Azure Event Hub using the provided connection string and event hub name.

Generate random stock data simulating real-world trading events.

Create an event batch and push the generated data into Event Hub at regular two-second intervals.

The script keeps streaming data indefinitely until manually stopped.

How to Run the Script
Clone or download the Python script to your local environment.

Install the required Python package:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install azure-eventhub
Execute the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python stock_streamer.py
Observe real-time events being printed to the console and sent to Azure Event Hub.

Example of a Generated Event

{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "price": 267.34,
  "volume": 4230,
  "timestamp": "2025-04-28T20:45:15.123456"
}
Console output during execution:

Troubleshooting
No data in Event Hub: Ensure that the connection string and event hub name match exactly, and that the Event Hub is running.

No module named 'azure.eventhub': Install the missing package using pip install azure-eventhub.

Script exits immediately: Check your Azure Event Hub permissions and network connectivity.

Data not appearing immediately: Confirm that the Event Hub partition settings and Stream Analytics job configurations match.
